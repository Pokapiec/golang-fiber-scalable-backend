# Golang app made to get more in touch with Go language and it's ecosystem

**It is supposed to teach me:**
- how to structure project for fairly large project
- how to deal with databases in golang language (especially gorm ORM and mongodb)
- how to setup developement environment for golang (Makefile and air for hot reloading)

And i hope the list will be expanding more and more !
